Sample PCF Client Application
==============================

Before uploading your app to Pivotal Web services, You need to configure the following services:
- Service Registry
- Config Server
- Circuit Breaker
- Redis-cloud

See https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/1-4/common/config-server/background-information.html

In addition a repository for properties is needed in order to configure the Config Server.
For This Demo, I am using https://github.com/eberttc/pcf-config-repo.


Config Server
****************
These are the parameters set in Config Server :
{
	"count": 1,
	"git": {
		"searchPaths": "{application}",
		"label": "master",
		"uri": "https://github.com/eberttc/pcf-config-repo.git"
	}
}

You can replace the uri with your own repository.

Circuit Breaker
*****************
For testing , we are using a public api that is going to be invoked by our application.
